my3d

YES THE CREDENTIALS ARE OPEN ACCESS SO IT IS DANGEROUS. BUT THEY ARE ONE-TIME AND WILL BE INVALID DUE TO MULTIPLE REQUESTS. I PUBLISHED THEM FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF DEVELOPING A WEB APPLICATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT DEVICES.

how to use:
make 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nenko9/my3d.git
```
in terminal
```sh
docker compose up
```
in browser open https://localhost:5000
