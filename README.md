YES THE CREDENTIALS ARE OPEN ACCESS SO IT IS DANGEROUS. BUT THEY ARE ONE-TIME AND WILL BE INVALID DUE TO MULTIPLE REQUESTS. I PUBLISHED THEM FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF DEVELOPING A WEB APPLICATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT DEVICES.

how to use:
make 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nenko9/my3d.git
```
in terminal
```sh
docker compose up
```
in browser open https://localhost:5000

Client Secret
This key allows your application to interact with Thingiverse. Keep it secret!

App Token
This token allows read only access to the Thingiverse API without requiring a user to authenticate. However, it also allows you to make changes to orders created by this app such as refunding and cancelling orders. So keep it secret and don't use it in client side javascript apps if your app involves payments!
